Hello! I‚Äôm Rafael Vieira Migon, a passionate Data Science student currently pursuing a Technologist degree in Data Science at *Faculdade Descomplica*. My journey into the world of data began during my studies in Astronomy at *Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)*, where I discovered my love for data analysis, statistical problem-solving, and writing clean, efficient code. While I initially explored the wonders of the universe, I found myself captivated by the power of data to uncover insights and solve real-world challenges.  

I thrive on tackling complex problems, breaking them down into manageable pieces, and finding creative solutions. My strengths lie in **statistical analysis** and **data visualization**, but I‚Äôm also deeply fascinated by **machine learning** and its potential to transform industries. I‚Äôm constantly learning and expanding my skill set to stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Java  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Google Sheets, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Interests**: Statistical modeling, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis  

### üìÇ Projects  
Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on or am currently developing:  
- **[Descomplica](https://github.com/rmigon/Descomplica)**: Projects for my Data Science course at Faculdade Descomplica.
- **[Astronomy](https://github.com/rmigon/Astronomy)**: Projects for my Astronomy course at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
- **[PS-Analytica](https://github.com/rmigon/PS-Analytica)**: A project for a selection process. I worked with a group of people to analyse and treat data from thousands of football matches and develop a machine learning model to predict results for future matches. 

### üåü About Me  
When I‚Äôm not immersed in data, you‚Äôll find me solving puzzles, learning new skills, playing games or connecting with people who share my curiosity for the world. I believe that every problem has a solution, and I‚Äôm always excited to take on new challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally.  

### üéØ Goals  
My ultimate goal is to leverage my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills to make a meaningful impact in the field of Data Science. I‚Äôm eager to find opportunities where I can shine, contribute to innovative projects, and continue learning from the incredible community of data professionals.
